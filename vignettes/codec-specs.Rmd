### Data

CODEC is designed to deal with tabular community-level data; for example:

- pediatric hospitalizations rate per month per census tract
- total number of gunshots per week per neighborhood
- housing code enforcement density per year per ZIP code

The required **census tract geography** and **date range** columns in a CODEC tabular-data-resource are used to specify the "where" and the "when" and importantly, can be used to link with other spatiotemporal health information:

#### Census Tract Geography

As tabular data that must specify a geography, a CODEC tabular-data-resource MUST include a [census tract](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/education/CensusTracts.pdf) column named `census_tract_id_{year}`, where `{year}` is replaced with the decennial vintage of the census tract geographies used to create the dataset (e.g., `census_tract_id_2010` or `census_tract_id_2020`).

The census tract identifier column MUST contain 11-digit [GEOID](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html) identifiers for *all* census tracts in Hamilton County (GEOID: 39061). A list of required census tract identifiers for 2000, 2010, and 2020 are available in the {{[cincy](https://github.com/geomarker-io/cincy)}} R package (e.g., `cincy::tract_tigris_2010`).

A CODEC `tdr` that was *not* created at a census tract level SHOULD link to a URL that contains code and a descriptive README file about how the data was harmonized (e.g., areal interpolation) with census tract geographies.

#### Date Range

- data must correspond to a year or month
- *or* require start_date and end_date and assume value represents temporal average of this time period

### File Structure

A CODEC `tabular-data-resource` (i.e., `tdr`) consists of a directory that MUST contain exactly one data (`.csv`) file and exactly one metadata file (`tabular-data-resource.yaml`).

The name of the directory and the name of the CSV file containing the data MUST be identical to the `name` [*property*](codec-metadata.html#tabular-data-resource-metadata).

For example,

    mydata
    ├── mydata.csv
    └── tabular-data-resource.yaml

Both files MUST be encoded using UTF-8 with newlines encoded as either `\n` or `\r\n`.

The data file must follow the [RFC 4180](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180) standard for CSV files.  In addition:

- the filename must end with `.csv`
- the first row MUST be a header row, containing the *unique* `name` of each *field*
- if a value is missing, it MUST be represented by either `NA` or an empty string (``)
  
The metadata file MUST be a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file named `tabular-data-resource.yaml` adhering to the metadata specifications.

### Metadata

Metadata is information *about* data, but does not contain the data itself. For example, a CSV file cannot tell R (or other software) anything about itself including:

- general information like its name, title, description, or homepage
- how missing values are denoted
- column names, titles, types, formats, and constraints
- specific CSV "dialect" characteristics required to read it (e.g. encoding, quoting)

CODEC utilizes a specific set of metadata specifications for community-level data in an effort to make them more interoperable and reusable.

#### Frictionless Standards

[Frictionless](https://frictionlessdata.io/) standards are a set of [patterns](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/) for describing data, including datasets, files, and tables. These metadata are contained in a specific file (separate from the data file), usually written in JSON or YAML, that describes something specific to each Frictionless Standard.

The CODEC metadata standards are based on the Frictionless [Tabular Data Resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-resource/) standards (often written as 'tabular-data-resource' and abbreviated throughout the package as `tdr`), which is composed of three Frictionless standards:

1. [Data Resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-resource/): describes an exact tabular file providing a path to the file and details like name, title, description, and more
2. [Table Schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/): describes a tabular file by providing its dimension, field data types, relations, and constraints
3. [CSV dialect](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/csv-dialect/): describes the various dialects of CSV files, including terminator strings, quoting rules, escape rules, etc.

A tabular-data-resource consists of (1) a *single* table of data and (2) its metadata, represented as a hierarchical list in a specific format.  On disk, this metadata is stored as a YAML file and in R, it is stored in the attributes of a data.frame (or tibble).

#### Tabular-Data-Resource Metadata

The metadata of a CODEC tabular-data-resource is hierarchically composed of different **descriptors** :

![](codec_metadata.png)

- **property** (or ["metadata property"](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-resource/#metadata-properties)) are named values used to describe the data resource. The value of most *properties* are a single character string (e.g., `name = "my_data"`), but some are lists.

- **schema** (or ["table schema"](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/)) is a special *property* that is a list of information about the **fields** (or columns) in a tabular-data-resource. *schema* includes a list of *fields*, as well as the value used to denote missingness and which *fields* are primary or foreign keys.

- **fields** (or ["field descriptors"](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/#field-descriptors)) is a special *schema descriptor* list of each of the *fields* in a tabular-data-resource, each with different *descriptors* containing *field*-specific information.

- **dialect** (or ["CSV dialect"](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/csv-dialect/)) is another special *property* that stores information about the formatting of the data CSV file. The [CODEC data standards](codec-data.html#codec-data-standards) require specific **dialect** values so that the `dialect` descriptor is not required for a CODEC tabular-data-resource.

A CODEC tabular-data-resource MUST contain `name` and `path` descriptors. All other properties, schema, and fields MAY be present, but MUST be one of:

```{r as.is = T, echo = F}
CODECtools::codec_tdr() |>
  purrr::map(tibble::enframe) |>
  tibble::enframe(name = "type", value = "data") |>
  dplyr::rowwise(type) |>
  dplyr::summarize(data, .groups = "drop") |>
  knitr::kable()
```

**All fields in the CSV data file MUST be described in the metadata and vice-versa.**

#### Example

An example CODEC tabular-data-resource looks like:

```yaml
name: tract_poverty
path: tract_poverty.csv
title: Fraction of Census Tract Households in Poverty
version: 1.2.1
description: measures derived from 5-yr 2019 American Community Survey
schema:
  fields:
    census_tract_id:
      name: census_tract_id
      title: Census Tract
      description: 2010 vintage census tract identifier
      type: string
    fraction_poverty:
      name: fraction_poverty
      title: Fraction of Households in Poverty
      type: number
```
