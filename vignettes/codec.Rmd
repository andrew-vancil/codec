## Metadata

Metadata is information *about* data, but not contain the data itself. For example, a CSV file, on its own, cannot tell R (or other software) anything about itself including:

- information about the general dataset like its name, path, title, description, license, or a related URL
- information about the formatting of the CSV file needed to read it (e.g. delimiter, encoding, quoting)
- how missing values are denoted
- which, if any, columns are unique identifiers or can be used to link to other datasets
- information about the columns in the dataset like their name, title, type, format, and any constraints

CODEC utilizes a specific set of standards to store community-level data in an effort to make them more interoperable.

## Frictionless Standards

[Frictionless](https://frictionlessdata.io/) standards are a set of [patterns](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/) for describing data, including datasets, files, and tables. These metadata are contained in a specific file (separate from the data file), usually written in JSON or YAML, that describes something specific to each Frictionless Standard.

The CODEC standards are based on the [Tabular Data Resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-resource/) (often written as `tabular-data-resource` and abbreviated throughout the package as `tdr`). A tabular-data-resource is made up of three Frictionless Standards:

1. [Data Resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-resource/): describes an *exact* tabular file providing a path to the file and details like name, title, description, and others
2. [Table Schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/): describes a tabular file by providing its dimension, field data types, relations, and constraints
3. [CSV dialect](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/csv-dialect/): describes the various dialects of CSV files, including terminator strings, quoting rules, escape rules, etc.

The tabular-data-resource is represented as a hierarchical list in a specific format.  On disk, this is stored as a YAML file and in R, this is stored in the attributes of a data.frame or tibble. Metadata consist of **descriptors**, **schema**, and **fields**:

![](codec_metadata.png)

- a **descriptor** (or ["metadata property"](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-resource/#metadata-properties)) is a named value stored as a string used to describe the data resource
- the **schema** (or ["table schema"](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/)) contains information about each of the **fields** (or "columns") within a tabular-data-resource as well as specifying the value used to denote missingness and which fields are primary keys and foreign keys

(This is a good place to note that although not used here, the [Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/) & [Tabular Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/) are similar to the Data Resource and Tabular Data Resource, except for that they describe a *collection* of tabular files.)


## CODEC Specifications

### CODEC Metadata

Currently, the CODEC data specification only supports the following descriptor, schema, and field properties:

```
codec_names <-
  list(
    descriptor = c(
      "name",
      "path",
      "title",
      "description",
      "url",
      "license",
      "schema"
    ),
    schema = c(
      "fields",
      "missingValues",
      "primaryKey"
    ),
    fields = c(
      "name",
      "title",
      "description",
      "type",
      "constraints"
    )
  )
```

### CODEC Data

- a [census tract](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/education/CensusTracts.pdf) column must be specified in metadata and named `census_tract_id_{year}`, where `{year}` is replaced with the decennial vintage of the census tract geographies used to create the dataset (e.g., `census_tract_id_2010` or `census_tract_id_2020`)
